[![Build Status](https://github.com/tgvaughan/bacter/workflows/Unit%2Fintegration%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tgvaughan/bacter/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Unit%2Fintegration+tests%22)

Bacter is a [BEAST 2](http://www.beast2.org)  package which facilitates
inference of a (restricted kind of) ancestral recombination graph (ARG) and
related parameters from a sequence alignment.  It is based on the model
described in [Didelot et al.'s 2010 Genetics paper][1].

This archive contains the source code of the package and is therefore of
primary interest to programmers.  For installation and usage instructions, as
well as links to tutorials and other documentation, please visit the project
home page hosted at http://tgvaughan.github.io/bacter.

* `/test` : Java source code (unit tests).
* `/templates` : BEAUti templates.
* `version.xml` : BEAST package version file.
* `build.xml` : Ant build script.
* `.gitignore` : Causes SCM to ignore certain files
* `.travis.yml` : Control file for Travis CI server
* `Dockerfile`: Used by Travis to build a reproducible test environment.
* `COPYING` : Software license.
* `README.md` : This file.

Building package from source
----------------------------

To build this package from source, ensure you have the following installed:

* Java JDK v1.8 
* Apache Ant v1.9 or later
* An internet connection

The internet connection is required since the build script downloads the most
recent version of the BEAST 2 source to build the package against.
Assuming both Java and Ant are on your execution path and your CWD is the root of
this archive, simply type "ant" from the command line to build the package.
This may take up to a minute due to the script fetching the BEAST source, and
the resulting binary will be left in the `/dist` directory.
To run the unit tests, use "ant test".
